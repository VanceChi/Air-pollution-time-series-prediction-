This includes two tasks, here is the task discription.

Task1:
Classification Task: You should develop a neural network that can
predict whether the concentration of Carbon Monoxide (CO) exceeds
a certain threshold – the mean of CO(GT) values – based on historical
air quality data. This task involves binary classification, where your
model learns to classify instances into two categories: above or below
the threshold. To determine the threshold, you must first calculate
the mean value for CO(GT), excluding unknown data (missing values).
Then, use this threshold to predict whether the value predicted by your
network is above or below it. You are free to choose and design your
own network, and there are no limitations on its structure. However,
your network should be capable of handling missing values.

Task2:
Regression Task: You should develop a neural network that can predict
the concentration of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) based on other air
quality features. This task involves estimating a continuous numerical
value (NOx concentration) from the input features using regression
techniques. You are free to choose and design your own network and
there is no limitation on that, however, your model should be able to
deal with missing values.
